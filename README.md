 Web Scraper 

This project scatters different canadian news sites such as CTV, CBC, CityNews and determines a sentiment level
ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. The data is graphed using MatPlotLib and determines an average sentiment (positive or negative) 
for the day. 

We can use this sentiment analyze for things such as Political and Social Analysis, Financial Market Analysis and Travel and Tourism. Based on the results of this program and sentiment level,
individuals can make informed decisions on certain things. 

Here is an example of the graph. It will take several news articles from the site of your choice and graph each news article between -0.5 to 0.5.

Future Changes (2023/2024):
- Allow for dynamic article gathering (code will break if Xcode changes)
- Allow for the user to enter a site while the program is running i.e hold the site with a variable instead of statically in code
