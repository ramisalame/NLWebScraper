 Web Scraper 

This project scatters different canadian news sites such as CTV, CBC, CityNews and determines a sentiment level
ranging from -0.5 to 0.5. The data is graphed using MatPlotLib and determines an average sentiment (positive or negative) 
for the day. 

We can use this sentiment analyze for things such as Political and Social Analysis, Financial Market Analysis and Travel and Tourism.
